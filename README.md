# Mason Jar Salads

## MVP
An app that allows users to create salad recipes and save them. Users will fill out a form with a dropdown (text input?) with salad components (e.g. greens, dressing, veggies, legumes, sweet (fruit, raisins, etc.), crunchy(nuts, croutons, etc.)) that creates a recipe based on certain proportions (1 cup greens, 2 tbsp dressing, etc.) and saves it for the user to retrieve.
