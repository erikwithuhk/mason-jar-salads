# [Mason Jar Salads](http://erik-jonsson.com/mason-jar-salads/)

Most days you can find me eating a salad out of a mason jar for lunch. They’re easy to make and store for a week’s worth of lunches, and keep me from spending money at Chipotle. Since the recipes for these salads usually pretty formulaic, I built a web app that would allow users to create and share their salad recipes.
